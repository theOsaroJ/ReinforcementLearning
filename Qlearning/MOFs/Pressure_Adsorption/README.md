The RL codes depending on the metric of interest are provided. 
Prior.csv refers to the initial training dataset which was set to be the bounds of the data (1 and 1E7 Pa) and the corresponding adsorption. Test.csv refers to the groundtruth data to be explored/exploitated by the RL agent.

Hyperparameter tuning was also done and the best parameters are chosen based on the best metric value (lowest MRE or highest R.square)

'''
This code as developed by Etinosa Osaro is believed to be generally applicalbe to any 1D dataset where picking the optimal training data is a challenge or not.
