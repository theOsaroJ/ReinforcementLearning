This folder contains the simulation input files required in the Active learning protocol used to generate the full adsorption isotherm. More details of this protocol is found in: https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.3c01589.

Things to do to run this AL algorithm:
A - i. Edit simulation.input to reflect MOF, the unit cells and pressures
    ii. Define the molecule - CO2 for carbondioxide and methane.
    iii. run ActiveLearning.sh with GP.py in same directory.
